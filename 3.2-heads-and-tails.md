To only have the first sonnet without the title, the following command can be used:

```bash
$ tail -n+3 sonnets-txt|head -n16
```

`tail -n+3` prints all lines starting with 3rd. Similarly `head -n-3` would print all lines ending with the 3rd last.

As to how to avoid the header being printed with the `head` command, I can't figure out.

Ignoring the header, I use `$head -n30 sonnets.txt|cat -n` to figure out which line sonnet 1 ends with:

```bash
$ head -n30 sonnets.txt|cat -n
     1	Shake-speare's Sonnets
     2	
     3	I
     4	
     5	From fairest creatures we desire increase,
     6	That thereby beauty's Rose might never die,
     7	But as the riper should by time decease,
     8	His tender heir might bear his memory:
     9	But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,
    10	Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,
    11	Making a famine where abundance lies,
    12	Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:
    13	Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,
    14	And only herald to the gaudy spring,
    15	Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
    16	And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:
    17	  Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
    18	  To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.
    19	
    20	II
    21	
    22	When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,
    23	And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,
    24	Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,
    25	Will be a tatter'd weed of small worth held:
    26	Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,
    27	Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;
    28	To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,
    29	Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.
    30	How much more praise deserv'd thy beauty's use,
```

`cat -n` prints out the given file with line numbers, which I used here by piping the first 30 lines through it. 
As can be seen above, the sonnet ends at line 18. Using `$head -18` would then give us only the first sonnet (including the title)

```bash
$ head -n 18 sonnets.txt 
Shake-speare's Sonnets

I

From fairest creatures we desire increase,
That thereby beauty's Rose might never die,
But as the riper should by time decease,
His tender heir might bear his memory:
But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,
Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,
Making a famine where abundance lies,
Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,
And only herald to the gaudy spring,
Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:
  Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
  To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.
